## [Drawing Purge](/apps/purge/) <img src="/img/purge.png" width="30" height="30" />
This plug-in helps to remove the unused DGN linetypes, textstyles, regapps and annotation scales and so many other items from either the current drawing or multiple drawings in batch processing.

## [My Xrefs](/apps/xrefs/)  <img src="/img/myxrefs.png" width="30" height="30" />
This plug-in will save all the xref properties to an external database, so that next time you can attach the xrefs very easily.
